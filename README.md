Python project that uses Pillow and PyautoGUI to automatically play a graphical game of solitare. It uses a traditional, non-ML algorithm for decision making, so it's not the most robust algorithm. But it works.

Note: This only works on a 16:9, 3840x2160 screen. (I specifically made this using the 4k XPS 9370)
